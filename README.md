### Viral Public License (VPL) Integration Guide

#### Introduction

The primary objective of this initiative is to widely disseminate the Viral Public License (VPL). The VPL promotes the free sharing and use of works while ensuring the original license conditions are preserved. This license encourages an open, collaborative approach, allowing anyone to contribute, use, and modify works without unnecessary restrictions. By spreading this license broadly, we aim to create an environment where creation and innovation can thrive, adhering to principles of transparency and sharing.

#### Making the License Valid

To make the Viral Public License (VPL) valid in a project, follow these steps to properly integrate it:

1. **Include the License File**: Add a file named `LICENSE.txt` or `COPYING.txt` containing the full text of the VPL to the root directory of your project.

2. **Add a License Header**: At the top of each source file in your project, add a comment indicating that the file is covered by the VPL. An example of a license header might be:

    ```text
    /*
     * This file is part of [Your Project Name].
     *
     * [Your Project Name] is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     * it under the terms of the Viral Public License (VPL) as published by
     * [Your Name or Organization].
     *
     * [Your Project Name] is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
     * Viral Public License for more details.
     *
     * You should have received a copy of the Viral Public License
     * along with [Your Project Name]. If not, see [URL to the license].
     */
    ```

3. **README File**: Mention the license in your `README.md` or `README.txt` file. This ensures that users are aware of the license when they first encounter your project. You can add a section like this:

    ```markdown
    ## License

    This project is licensed under the Viral Public License (VPL). See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) file for details.
    ```

4. **Source Code Distribution**: Ensure that any redistribution of your project includes the complete source code and retains the VPL.

5. **Credit Preservation**: While not required, it is recommended to credit the original authors in a `CREDITS.txt` or a similar file.
